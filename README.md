Codecademy - Week 7 - Capstone Project


This project was created as a webpage that uses the culminated knowledge from Weeks 1 to 7 of Codecademy's Ready program. HTML, CSS, Flexbox, Transitions, etc. Some of the reasons for the design direction are explained below:


Background colours, font colours and transition colours were chosen with the intention of being both welcoming and professional for an academy institution.

CSS is organized by sections of the website from top to bottom. Each section followed by their Media queries to help each section change according to the various device sizes.

Transitions were added to help with navigation and identifying featured items, and not over glamourize the essence of the site so as to keep inline with the intended audience.

Video was assigned to pre-load but not auto play since the video was all the way at the bottom. Therefore making it ready to play if the viewer chooses to but would not just play if the viewer is still at the top and has not reached the bottom of the page.
